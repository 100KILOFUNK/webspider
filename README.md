I made the structure for our project, which, when writing this, 
consists of three scripts; curler.bash, dispatchloop.bash and 
grapher.bash. What they are supposed do is written inside the 
files. The curler script is almost finished, need some more 
tinkering but extracts all the links from the parameter and 
stores it in the workinglist file. 

The Format of workinglist.txt is:
(SOURCEDOMAIN) (SOURCEPATH) (TARGETDOMAIN) (TARGETPATH)
